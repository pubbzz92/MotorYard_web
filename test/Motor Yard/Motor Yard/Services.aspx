To search the needed spare part, he/she might have to go for several shops. Sometimes they might have paid a lot of money on an item without knowing that there’s another place where the same item is available for a lower price. People very often undergo these kinds of hardships when dealing with motor spare part needs. To avoid this Motor Yard will be the ideal solution.<br /><br />
The only thing the customer has to do is just typing on the search box, the exact name of the spare part. Then the website will display the availability of that item, the particular shop that the item is available and its location, the contact details of the dealers etc. This will be so efficient and accurate.
If the item is not available, the customer could request for that item too.<br /><br />
Vehicle spare parts dealers face many problems. Although they have a bulk of spare parts, the customer doesn’t know whether a certain item is available or not. This is due to poor advertising. To overcome this we have allocated a personal advertising space for the dealers in our website.
It is so hard for the dealer to manually update the stocks. Very often there will be irregularities. We have proposed an inventory control system which would be ideal to get rid of this. This system also includes a billing system which records all the transactions made and automatically calculates the profit. The dealer has to purchase this system when registering in our website.</p>
